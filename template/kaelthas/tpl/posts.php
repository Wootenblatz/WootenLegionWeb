    <h1>Welcome to Wootenmane!</h1>

<h3><strong>Step 1 – WoW 7.3.5 (for Legion)</strong></h3>
<p>Legion is available from this page <a href="https://wowmortal.com/download.php">https://wowmortal.com/download.php</a> as a &quot;Magnet link&quot; if you click &quot;7.3.5 Full Client Torrent(Magnet)&quot;.  You will need to install a bit torrent client that can open this kind of link before trying to open it.  You can also google where to download Legion if this method does not work for you.</p>
<p>If you do not have a bit torrent client, I like Transmission: <a href="https://transmissionbt.com/">https://transmissionbt.com/</a></p>
<p>You can also download the client directly from <a href='/LegionClient.zip'>here</a></p>

<h3><strong>Step 3 - Get some Addons (Optional)</strong></h3>
<p>Legion addons are available from these sites.  You may need to search for older versions or filter for addons that work with 7.3.5.</p>

<h3><strong>Step 4 - Start the game and make some characters!</strong></h3>
<p>Notes on character creation:
Death Knights, Demon Hunters and Allied races are available if you have at least one level 1 character on your account.  If you want to play as any of these, create a regular character first, log out and then you can create a new toon with the heroic classes and allied races.</p>
<p>This server is running a very complete repack that supports the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic XP per character</li>
<li>Very complete quest system with few bugs</li>
<li>Optional skips for Death Knights, Demon Hunters, Pandarens, Goblins and Worgen.  Check your inventory for the scroll that lets you skip these areas.</li>
<li>A battle.net like shop that lets you convert game gold into battle coins to buy mounts, heirlooms, boosts and more.</li>
<li>Mythic Plus Dungeons</li>
<li>Allied races available at level 1</li>
<li>Full cross faction interactions are enabled! Horde and Alliance can<ul>
<li>Chat with each other, including using emotes</li>
<li>Trade, buy/sell on the AH and send mail with each other</li>
<li>Join the same party, raid and guild</li>
<li>Add other side to friends list and see players with /who</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is an auction house bot that will buy and sell items automatically</li>
<li>Every time you use a gathering node, you will receive 5x the materials you would have gotten normally.</li>
<li>Professions level up at a 5x rate with higher combines for yellow and green receipes.</li>
<li>You can learn all professions on a single character</li>
<li>Guild charters require 2 signatures and the fees are drastically lower</li>
